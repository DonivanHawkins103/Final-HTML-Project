                    <h3>95/100</h3>

                    <P>
                    Minecraft is a game centered around creativity where the goal as the player is 
                    to get to the End Dimension and beat the ruler there known as the Ender Dragon
                    and although beating the Dragon is the goal, the main purpose is to gather resources and
                    create things within the world.
                    <br><br>

                    This game gets a 95/100 because it is very fun to play by yourself or with friends
                    and can be played basically infinitely but can get repetitive.
                    </p>

                    <h3>100/100</h3>

                    <P>
                    The Witcher 3 is a game centered around Geralt of Rivia as he tries to find Ciri, a girl
                    he trained as a child to fight monsters, as she is getting chased by the Wild Hunt. The wild hunt 
                    are beings who desire Ciri's power and are trying to take her for it. There is magic, swords,
                    and monsters all in this medieval warzone atmosphere.


                    <br><br>

                    This game gets a 100/100 because it has a very detailed story, amazing mechanics, great characters
                    but the one downside of the game is that when you are done with it any other game feels mediocre.

                    <h2>Portal 2</h2>
                    
                    <h3>79/100</h3>

                    <P>
                    Portal 2 is an amazing sequel to the first Portal game and is based around this gun that can shoot
                    two separate portals and you need to use them to solve puzzles and make your way through the world
                    while dodging obstacles.


                    <br><br>

                    This game gets a 79/100 because although the story is good and the puzzles are challenging and 
                    has cool mechanics the game feels very linear and does not have much "meat" in the plot. This is not
                    to say the game is bad in the slightest.
