                    <h3>88/100</h3>

                    <P>
                    Impractical Jokers is a show on TruTV about a group of 4 friends who tell 
                    each other what to do in public and usually ends up being very
                    embarrassing for the person out in public. By completing every task asked of them
                    the one in public wins and does not get a thumbs down, the person with the most
                    thumbs down at the end does a challenge usually correlating to their fears.  <br><br>

                    This show gets an 88/100 because it is very funny but can be 
                    repetitive and slightly inappropriate to watch.

                    Their main enemy, the Ice King, tries to steal princesses and Finn and Jake always stop it from happening <br><br>

                    This show gets a 96/100 because it has a good story, is funny, and has great characters 
                    but it is also meant mostly for kids so there are a lot of dumb jokes throughout the show.
